📌 Project: Automatic Pipe Removal from Technical Diagrams
This project focuses on automatically removing connecting pipes from P&ID technical diagrams while preserving symbols using Python, OpenCV, and Deep Learning (U-Net, optional).

📌 Problem Statement
Engineering diagrams contain symbols (pumps, valves, sensors) connected by pipes. The task is to remove all pipes while preserving symbols.

Input: Technical diagram (P&ID) with symbols & pipes.
Output: The same diagram with pipes removed but symbols intact.
📌 Solution Approach
✔ Step 1: Convert PDF-based diagrams to PNG images.
✔ Step 2: Preprocess images (grayscale, edge detection).
✔ Step 3: Use morphological operations to detect pipes.
✔ Step 4: Apply image inpainting to remove detected pipes.
✔ Step 5: Detect symbols & extract text metadata using OCR.
✔ Step 6 (Optional): Train a U-Net deep learning model for better accuracy.

📌 Technologies Used
Library	Purpose
OpenCV	Image processing & pipe detection
NumPy	Image operations & array handling
Matplotlib	Visualization of results
Tesseract OCR	Text extraction from diagrams
TensorFlow/Keras	U-Net deep learning model (optional)

📌 Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Install Required Libraries
Run the following command in your VS Code terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib pdf2image pytesseract tensorflow
2️⃣ Install Poppler (For PDF to Image Conversion)
Windows: Download & extract from Poppler for Windows.
Add C:\poppler\bin to your system PATH.
Linux/macOS: Run:
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install poppler-utils
📌 How to Run the Code
Step 1: Convert PDF to Images
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python convert_pdf.py
✅ Output: Saves P&ID diagrams as PNG images.

Step 2: Preprocess Images
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python preprocess.py
✅ Output: Prepares binary images with pipes & symbols separated.

Step 3: Remove Pipes
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python remove_pipes.py
✅ Output: Saves cleaned images with pipes removed.

Step 4: Detect Symbols
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python detect_symbols.py
✅ Output: Highlights detected symbols.

Step 5: Extract Text Labels (OCR)
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python extract_text.py
✅ Output: Extracted engineering metadata printed in the terminal.

(Optional) Step 6: Train U-Net Model
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python train_unet.py
✅ Output: Trains deep learning model for improved pipe removal.
